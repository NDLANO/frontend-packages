# NDLA frontend packages

[Monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md) containing a set of packages used to build UIs at NDLA. By definition this repo is maintained using [yarn v4](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).

## Installation

Using windows? See notes at the bottom.

```js
yarn add [package-name]
```

To view all of the available packages, see the [`packages/` directory](packages).

## Development

### Setup

Install root dependencies and [bootstrap](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#bootstrap) packages.

```js
yarn && yarn bootstrap
```

Se package README for package specific details.

### Lint and format

Run lint and format check for all packages:

```js
yarn lint
```

### Test

Run tests for all packages:

```js
yarn test
```

### Check all

Make sure everthing is OK before push:

```js
yarn check-all
```

### Develop

```js
yarn start
```

#### Usage during development

```js
cd packages/[package-name]
yarn link
```

In repo using the package (ie. ndla-frontend). Forces usage of the same react versions as in frontend-packages.

```js
yarn link @ndla/[package-name] react react-dom react-router react-router-dom
yarn
```

## Publishing

### Publish packages to npmjs

```js
yarn run publish
```

If script was interrupted, resulting in new versions being commited but not published to npm, this can be resolved by running

```
yarn lerna publish from-package
```

### Alias master to designmanual.ndla.sh

```js
yarn deploy
```

## New Icons

### Download icon

As mentioned on https://designmanual.ndla.no/?path=/story/components--icons, new icons are downloaded from https://material.io/icons/. Find the icon needed and download it. Missing icons can in need be fetched from https://materialdesignicons.com or created from scratch. Afterwards copy it to the best matching sub-folder in `frontend-packages/packages/ndla-icons/svg/`. Edit the svg and add license information matching the other svg files.

### Generate typescript component file

Navigate to the root of frontend-packages and run `node scripts/createTsIconComponents.mjs`. This will generate typescript files for all the svg files, including the newly added one. When finished, create a PR with the new files (should only be svg and ts files). Make sure to publish frontend-packages for the new icons to be available.

## Upcoming features and updates

### Upcoming updates to the designmanual can be previewed here.

## Windows

Powershell is currently not supported as it does not recognize `cp` commands for copying in the package.json scripts. GitBash or equivalent will work. WSL is also recommended if you want to use Windows.
