    <h2>What is cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies is a standard technology used by almost all websites. A cookie is
      a small file created by a website on your computer (if your browser allows
      it, which it will have as a default setting). The cookie can contain
      different kinds of information, but is mainly used for saving information
      on how you use the website, and to give you a better experience while
      using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, as an example, you log in to ndla.no, a cookie will be created to
      indicate that you are logged in. When later you return to the site, the
      browser will remember that you are logged in, which will allow you access
      without logging in again. Cookies usually have a set time limit, so if you
      don’t revisit the site in a while, the cookie will be removed from the
      browser
    </p>
    <h2>What do I accept by using this website?</h2>
    <p>
      You accept that we save the compiled statistics, like where in the world
      you are visiting from, which browser you use, which pages you visit and
      other technical interesting data about your visit on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collected information is used for analyzing trends, so that we can
      improve our website for you as a user. The data we collect can not be used
      for identifying you personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t want us to collect this data, it is possible to turn off
      cookies in your browser. Our website (as well as a lot of other websites)
      then may stop working optimally.
